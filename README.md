# GoogleFoobar

According to rumors Google Foobar challenge is a secret hiring process by Google.

I was invited to the challenge in September 2020 after searching for another code related term in Google. I have not only completed all 5 levels well ahead of the deadlines, but also revealed an inaccuracy in their test system. I was asked to send my CV, but haven't heard anything back since then. Nevertheless, I enjoyed solving their puzzles.Â
